# PerfectFit virtual coach backend prototype

This should become a working prototype that can handle the following scenario: 
* User sends a message in the NiceDay app with the intent to get the planning for the next week 
* In response the Virtual Coach sends back the weekly planning that should include: 
  - Some information about the user queried from the database 
  - Some reference to psycho-education that comes from a ‘content’ file (that will later be controlled by Leiden)
  - Some information from several algorithms (nice to have)

(optional):
- The virtual coach asks the user whether it can plan these activities.
- If affirmative, the virtual coach adds these activities to the calendar of the client.
